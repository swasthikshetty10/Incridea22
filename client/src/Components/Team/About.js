                <p className="font-body pb-4 text-gray-100 text-md md:text-lg text-center">Incridea is all about the competitive spirit. Providing a platform for the exhibition of utmost creativity, our fest has managed to attract students from professional colleges all over the country. With a footfall of over 25,000 participants in the campus and 50+ events planned and executed, Incridea has reached a new zenith. <br />
                    A hub of entertainment and education, Incridea has managed to display a flair for perfection. Ranging from quizzes to robotic warfare, we have got it all, along with a few special attractions that we would like to call our Flagship Events.
                    This time we only aim to go higher and higher </p>
